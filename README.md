**"About agy-pptx-studio"**

Welcome to **agy-pptx-studio**, a dedicated ecosystem and monorepo designed specifically for AI-driven, highly aesthetic presentation (PPTX) generation. This repository centralizes tools, skills, and plugins necessary to construct, style, and generate rich slide decks using Antigravity AI agents. By utilizing Domain-Driven Design (DDD), this studio ensures all features within the ecosystem are cohesive and optimized for presentation creation.

### 1. 🤖 Multi-Agent Workflow (Presentation Architect)
This core plugin is structured as a **Multi-Agent Department**, acting as the brain for generating highly aesthetic presentations. The workflow enforces a strict sequential pipeline, coordinated by the **Orchestrator**, which receives the initial user command and delegates tasks:

> **workflow**: `[User Input]` ➔ 🔍 `Researcher` ➔ 📝 `Strategist` ➔ 🎨 `Art Director` ➔ 🛠️ `Engineer` ➔ `[Output PPTX]`

* **🔍 Researcher (presentation-researcher)**:
    Begins by gathering raw data, performing deep analysis, and extracting necessary insights, saving them to a physical research file.
* **📝 Strategist (presentation-strategist)**:
    Constructs a logical, compelling narrative storyboard. It determines the flow of the slides and outputs a foundational outline.
* **🎨 Art Director (presentation-art-director)**:
    Applies design system constraints, selects typography and color palettes, invokes the image generator for necessary visuals, and finalizes the strict `_blueprint.yaml`.
* **🛠️ Engineer (presentation-engineer)**:
    Executes the blueprint using the `pptxgenjs` Node.js library to render the final, physical `.pptx` file.

### 2. 🏛️ Style Architect & Renovation
This ecosystem also includes a **Style Architect (`presentation-style-architect`)**, a meta-agent responsible for designing rigid layout geometries and highly flexible color systems.
* **Importing & Renovating Old Decks**: When a user provides an existing `.pptx` file, the orchestrator invokes a specialized Python script (`extract_pptx.py`) to extract the raw text outline. The Style Architect can then analyze this outline and perfectly map it onto modern, aesthetic design grids without breaking the original content structure.

### 3. 🖼️ Image Generation Enhancements
This module serves as the visual asset creator. It heavily modifies and enhances Antigravity's built-in `generate_image` command, overcoming native limitations to produce production-ready assets.

* **Zero-Text / Zero-Subject Backgrounds**: The native image generation often creates messy images. Our `background-generation-formula` enforces strict rules (`NO TEXT, NO WORD`) to generate clean, highly-readable backgrounds and UI overlays.
* **Prompt Enhancer**: Uses a 7-layer structural formula for general cinematic images, and a 5-layer formula (`diagram-generation-formula`) tailored for conceptual visualizations like timelines, funnels, and process cycles.
* **Custom Aspect Ratio Solutions**: The native tool is locked to generating 1:1 square images. To solve this, the orchestrator uses a clever "padding prompt" technique combined with an automated Python script (`crop_image.py`) to physically crop the output into precise 16:9, 9:16, or custom aspect ratios.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Agent Framework**: Antigravity, LangChain (Skills & Agents)
* **Presentation Rendering**: Node.js (`pptxgenjs`)
* **Image Processing**: Python (Pillow / Image Cropping scripts)
* **Design Systems**: YAML, JSON (Decoupled layout engines)

```

### 1. Installation
Clone this project and link the plugins to your Antigravity configuration:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YuJunWang/agy-pptx-studio.git
```
*(Place or symlink the two plugin folders into your Antigravity `.gemini/config/plugins` directory to enable them in your workspace.)*

### 2. Usage Example
To trigger the complete multi-agent workflow, you can simply use a comprehensive prompt like this:

> "Based on coffee industry research from the past two years, act as a local coffee supplier in Taiwan and create a 15-minute pitch deck for venture capitalists. Execute this in a McKinsey consulting presentation style, including as much data and as many charts as necessary. You can decide on any other unspecified details."
